# KnotMyYacht 
KnotMyYacht is a revolutionary software platform designed specifically for the recreational water sports industry.  Our custom-built software creates a new process to link consumers to a real-time updating inventory of boats, yachts, jet skis and much more, while allowing the rental agency staff to seamlessly manage customers and process transactions.  With the lightest and most affordable platform available for the watercraft-rental industry, Helm by KnotMyYacht is the single solution that integrates the many elements of management software into one scalable web application.  With the integration of a fleet management tool, point of sale system, reservation and booking process, and a consumer-facing AirBnB-style model, rental agencies can say goodbye to the need for scheduling sheets, logbooks, bulky accounting software and third party distribution channels.
